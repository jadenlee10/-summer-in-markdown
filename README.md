# My summer In a Nutshell
<h2> First Thing I did over Summer ! </h2>

<p>Over the Summer, I went to an area I have never been to that is very famous for tourists. I went to Hawaii which was a new experience for me as it was my first time. This trip was both stunning and angering at the same time because I had a three day volleyball tournament during this week. I had to miss this important event which made me pretty devastated. However, the bad things didn't end there. I unfortunately, got sick on our third day of the trip which made me miss the Diamond Head hike. However, going to the beach really helped and made the whole experience a little bit more enjoyable.</p>
